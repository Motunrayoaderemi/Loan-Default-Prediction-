In light of the dynamic changes in the financial sector and the increasing volume of loan applications, a significant portion of the population actively seeks bank loans. However, a notable challenge faced by the banking sector in this ever-evolving economy is the growing prevalence of loan defaults. Banking authorities grapple with heightened challenges in accurately assessing loan applications and effectively managing the risks associated with individuals failing to meet their loan obligations. These applications undergo thorough scrutiny and approval based on diverse criteria, including Lifetime Value, income levels, employment statuses, and risk evaluation mechanisms.

The objective of this research was to explore various machine learning algorithms to develop a consumer loan approval system capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of an applicant's default before the approval process. The primary goals of this research are twofold: (i) to present a comprehensive visualization of loan performance using Power BI dashboards, and (ii) to conduct an extensive and comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms for predicting loan defaults. The study utilizes authentic borrower loan data from Lending Club to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Artificial Neural Networks, employing a diverse set of evaluation metrics.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) yielded an accuracy rate of 69.18% and an AUC of 65.80%. Consequently, the ANN model emerges as a more favorable choice compared to other algorithms for predicting potential loan defaulters among consumers. The findings suggest that financial institutions should prioritize applicants with higher Lifetime Value and Income during the pre-approval stage.
